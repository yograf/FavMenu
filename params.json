Possible menu items are:\r\n\r\n * a folder (command: `cd <path>`  for example: `cd D:\\Documents`)\r\n * executable (command: `<path_to_exe>` for example: `notepad.exe` or `d:\\tools\\gfie\\gfie.exe`)\r\n   (in fact, any file could be added)\r\n\r\nNote that environment variables could be used in command, for example:\r\n`cd %APPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome`.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Total Commander's Directory Hotlist as the menu, just\r\nset path of TC's `wincmd.ini` as FavMenu's menu definition ini file, in\r\n`Setup->Configuration`.  In this case, You can use TC plugin path in the\r\ncommand, for example: `cd \\\\\\Uninstaller\\` or `cd \\\\\\Registry\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Sofware`\r\n\r\n### Bring up the menu ###\r\n\r\nWhen you want to jump to one of your favorite folder, just bring up the\r\nmenu.  To do this, you need to set a system-wide hotkey in\r\n`Setup->Configuration`.\r\n\r\nIf current application/dialog is supported by FavMenu, it would let the\r\napplication jump to the folder you clicked. Otherwise, it would open\r\nthat folder in the default file manager (which is configurable in\r\n`Setup->Configuration`).\r\n\r\n### Advanced Usage ###\r\n\r\n**The menu**:\r\n   \r\n  * `Ctrl+Enter` on menu item: open properties dialog for the menu item\r\n  * `Shift+Enter` on menu item: open selected folder in new tab (if target\r\n    application supports this)\r\n  * `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` on menu item: send path of selected item to active window\r\n\r\n**Pseudo variables in path**:\r\n\r\nFavMenu supports Total Commander's pseudo variables, such as `$DESKTOP`,\r\n`$PERSONAL`, refer `Includes/pseudo.ahk` for detailed info.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
